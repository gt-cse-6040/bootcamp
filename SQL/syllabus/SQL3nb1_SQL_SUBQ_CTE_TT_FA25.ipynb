    "## Temp Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "In SQLite, temporary tables (or temp tables) are used to store data temporarily during the course of a session. \n",
    "\n",
    "These tables are very useful for intermediate results, complex queries, or storing temporary data without affecting the main schema of the database. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data in a temporary table is automatically deleted when the session ends or when the database connection is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporary Tables Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*    `Temporary Scope`: Temporary tables only exist for the duration of the database session. Once the connection is closed, the temporary tables are dropped automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*    `Session-Specific`: They are available only to the database connection that created them. Other connections cannot access the temporary tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*    `Prefix`: Temporary tables are created with the keyword TEMP or TEMPORARY, but TEMP is optional in SQLite. They are stored in memory by default, but you can configure them to be stored on disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*    `No Impact on Schema`: Temporary tables are separate from the permanent database schema, so they do not affect the structure or data of the main tables.\n",
