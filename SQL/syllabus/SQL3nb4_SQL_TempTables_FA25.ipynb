        "\n",
        "*    `Temporary Scope`: Temporary tables only exist for the duration of the database session. Once the connection is closed, the temporary tables are dropped automatically.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "*    `Prefix`: Temporary tables are created with the keyword TEMP or TEMPORARY, but TEMP is optional in SQLite. They are stored in memory by default, but you can configure them to be stored on disk.\n",
        "\n",
        "*    `No Impact on Schema`: Temporary tables are separate from the permanent database schema, so they do not affect the structure or data of the main tables."
