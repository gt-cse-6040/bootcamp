    "## Subqueries -- Quick Review\n",
    "\n",
    "An inline subquery is a query nested within another SQL query, typically within the SELECT, WHERE, or FROM clause. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inline subqueries allow you to perform calculations or filtering within the context of the outer query. \n",
    "\n",
    "They are particularly useful when you need to filter results based on aggregated values like maximum, minimum, or average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inline subqueries are powerful, but they can become less efficient when the same calculation needs to be repeated multiple times, as each repetition can slow down the query execution. \n",
