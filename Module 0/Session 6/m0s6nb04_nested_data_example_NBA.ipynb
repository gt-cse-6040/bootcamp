The statistics show how the offensive player performed, using various offensive metrics, while being guarded by the defensive player. They include such metrics as the number of games against each other, the total number of minutes that the defensive player guarded the offensive player, points scored, assists, field goal percentage, and the like. The statistics are compiled over the multiple games that the two players' teams played each other over that season.\n",

For example, let's say that the offensive player averaged 20 points per 48 minute game for the season. And then let's say that the offensive player scored 10 points in 48 minutes, while matched up against a particular defender. That defender would be considered very good, because he held the offensive player to half of their points per game."
