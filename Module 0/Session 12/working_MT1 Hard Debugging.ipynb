That's okay! You will need to debug your code to determine what is causing the issue(s) and then figure out to how fix them. So how can we get better at debugging? We practice!\n","\n","Below are four 1 point exercises from the Spring 2023 Midterm 1. We have pre-written solutions for each exercise that are \"bad\" in one or more ways. Our solutions may contain one or more logic and/or syntax errors. Can you find and fix the issues in each exercise and pass all of the test cases?\n","\n","Right before each exercise test cell, there is a block of text explaining the variables available to you for debugging. You may use these to test your code and can print/display them as needed.\n","\n","<br/>\n","\n","**Exercise point breakdown:**\n","\n","- Exercise 2: **3** points\n","- Exercise 8: **2** points\n","- Exercise 9: **3** points\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"44bea3e0","metadata":{"nbgrader":{"grade":false,"locked":true,"solution":false},"tags":["topic_intro"],"id":"44bea3e0"},"source":["# Background: Mining for Friends #\n","\n","In this notebook, you will analyze social media data from Twitter and FourSquare. Your ultimate goal will be to help people find others with common interests.\n","\n","The (anonymized) data consists of the following:\n","\n","- A collection of places, or _points of interest_ (POIs), like restaurants, movie theaters, post offices, museums, and so on.\n","- A database of cities.\n","- A collection of _check-ins_, that is, the places that a specific person has visited.\n","- Existing _connections_, that is, \"who follows whom\" type relationships.\n","\n","We will analyze this data and then, by the very last exercise, create a function that can, for a given person, recommend other people they might be compatible with based on their affinity for the same places.\n","\n","Start by running the next cell, which will set up some of the code and data you'll need
