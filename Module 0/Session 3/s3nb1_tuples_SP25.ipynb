    "\n",
    "**Ordered**: They contain elements that are sequentially arranged according to their specific insertion order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indexable through a zero-based index**: They allow you to access their elements by integer indices that start from zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Immutable**: They don’t support in-place mutations or changes to their contained elements. They don’t support growing or shrinking operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heterogeneous**: They can store objects of different data types and domains, including mutable objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nestable**: They can contain other tuples, so you can have tuples of tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iterable**: They support iteration, so you can traverse them using a loop or comprehension while you perform operations with each of their elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sliceable**: They support slicing operations, meaning that you can extract a series of elements from a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Combinable**: They support concatenation operations, so you can combine two or more tuples using the concatenation operators, which creates a new tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hashable**: They can work as keys in dictionaries when all the tuple items are immutable.\n",
