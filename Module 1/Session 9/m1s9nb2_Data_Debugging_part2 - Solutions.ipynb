This is a small startup so you have to \"wear many different hats,\" so to speak. Your first task on the job is to set up their data warehousing so that they can capture a historical record of their operations for analysis later. The operational database (which someone else has already set up) only contains the current state of the operation to maintain maximum efficiency while performing tasks like adding new customers, changing services, applying promotions, etc. It will not contain any history and is not intended have complex queries run against it.\n",

In the cell below we have included the function `dfs_to_conn` which can be used to create in-memory database connections. If you pass in a dictionary mapping table names to DataFrames, `dfs_to_conn` will return a sqlite 3 connection with all of the data in the DataFrames available under the names given as keys. You are also free to write to the in-memory database by creating tables, inserting/deleting/updating records, etc. Anything that SQLite allows should work!\n",

We will be rebuilding the entire journal, so we need to partition the existing journal into active and not-active records and return both parts. The active records will be compared with the business data, and the inactive records will be included in the updated journal without modification. Additionally, on the initial load, there will not be an existing journal, so we will need to create it based on the data being loaded and the desired audit columns.\n",
