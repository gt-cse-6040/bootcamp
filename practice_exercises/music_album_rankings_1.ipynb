    "\n",
    "1. Give students some practice problems that are put together in a similar manner to what they will encounter on MidTerm 1. While the notebooks are hosted on Colab and do not contain the \"test case variables\", the exercises are laid out in a manner the copies how the MidTerm exercises are constructed. Each exercise in notebooks 2-5 is set up to show a suggested exercise at that point value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Provide the students with some additional exercises for the students to practice concepts that are typically tested on the first MidTerm.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Provide the students with opportunities to build on their knowledge of basic Python data structures, nested data structures, implementing mathematics, and string manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### There are 5 sets of notebooks in the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The first notebook (this one) provides an introduction to the topic and the datasets that the students will be working with.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The student working notebook, with the code cells for students to solve the exercises.\n",
    "2. The solution notebook, with code provided, for students to see one way of solving each exercise.\n",

    "- NB 1:  Introduction to the Topic and Data Sets (This notebook).\n",
    "- NB2:  Example 1-point exercises (3 exercises).\n",

    "`Rolling Stone` magazine is an American monthly magazine that focuses on music, politics, and popular culture. It was founded in San Francisco, California in 1967 and still publishes monthly to this day. The magazine is known for its coverage of music, entertainment, and politics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2003, the magazine released its `“500 Greatest Albums of All Time,”` placing the Beatles’ “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” in the top slot. It has since released two additional `\"500 Greatest\"` lists, in 2012 and 2020. While not necessary for this analysis, to gain a full understanding of these rankings, see this Wikipedia article:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone%27s_500_Greatest_Albums_of_All_Time\n",

    "#### Our analysis will focus on the changes in the three lists over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `2003` list was heavily criticized for being male-dominated, outmoded, and almost entirely Anglo-American in focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `2012` list was also heavily critcised in a similar manner, with one music critic noting that the only one album in the top 10 was less than 40 years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `2020` list was much more diverse in its representation of different music genres, musicians, and time periods. Music critics were much more positive in their reviews of the list, noting the lesser representation of white male rock musicians, and the move to recognize more contemporary albums and a wider range of tastes.\n"
