    "`Rolling Stone` magazine is an American monthly magazine that focuses on music, politics, and popular culture. It was founded in San Francisco, California in 1967 and still publishes monthly to this day. The magazine is known for its coverage of music, entertainment, and politics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2003, the magazine released its `“500 Greatest Albums of All Time,”` placing the Beatles’ “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” in the top slot. It has since released two additional `\"500 Greatest\"` lists, in 2012 and 2020. While not necessary for this analysis, to gain a full understanding of these rankings, see this Wikipedia article:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone%27s_500_Greatest_Albums_of_All_Time\n",

    "\n",
    "- The `2003` list was heavily criticized for being male-dominated, outmoded, and almost entirely Anglo-American in focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `2012` list was also heavily critcised in a similar manner, with one music critic noting that the only one album in the top 10 was less than 40 years old.\n",

    "- The `2020` list was much more diverse in its representation of different music genres, musicians, and time periods. Music critics were much more positive in their reviews of the list, noting the lesser representation of white male rock musicians, and the move to recognize more contemporary albums and a wider range of tastes."
