    "In 2003, the magazine released its `“500 Greatest Albums of All Time,”` placing the Beatles’ “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” in the top slot. It has since released two additional `\"500 Greatest\"` lists, in 2012 and 2020. While not necessary for this analysis, to gain a full understanding of these rankings, see this Wikipedia article:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone%27s_500_Greatest_Albums_of_All_Time\n",
